Install and load important packages:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


**************************** PART 1 **************************************

Import the dataset:
```{r}
data <- read.table("~/GitHub/Advent-of-Code/2024/Inputs/Day2.txt", # Reads the table from the GitHub directory.
           header = FALSE, # Indicates that the data has no headers.
           sep = " ", # Data is separated by a blank space.
           fill = NA) # If no value is present, report it as NA.
```

Now lets try to check whether the row is "safe" or "unsafe":
```{r}
data <- data %>%
  mutate(across())
```

```{r}
data <- data %>%
  mutate(safe_report = abs(V1 - V2) <= 3)
```
